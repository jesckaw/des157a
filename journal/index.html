            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows"</a> explains that these interface designs: modal windows, overlays, and dialog windows are tools employed to quickly provide users with additional information without having them leave their current page. </p>

            <p>Here some of the best practices for these tools. Modal windows is to keep them concise, relevant, and accessible while providing an easy way to close them. Overlay best practices should ensure that content is displayed in the foreground with a distinct contrast, is clearly visible, and is free from any distractions.Dialog window best practice should include a clear title, concise content, and a prominent call-to-action to help guide users towards the desired outcome. </p>

            <p>Overall the best practices for modals, overlays, and dialog windows are to keep them concise and to the point, use them sparingly, keep the content relevant and concise, ensure they don't interfere with the user's progress, and provide an easy way to close the modal. Additionally, designers should consider the accessibility of these components, making sure to include appropriate focus and tab order, alt text, and color contrast.</p>

            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design"</a> provides valuable insights and guidelines for UX designers looking to create effective and user-friendly forms. The author covers various topics in form design, such as form length and content, input types, instructions and validation, accessibility, and user testing. </p>

            <p>When making forms, it’s important to keep them short by using clear and concise language, and labeling form fields. Input types should also be appropriately stated for each field. Forms should include clear instructions, real-time validation, and feedback to provide a good user experience. Accessibility and user testing are also important pieces to gain feedback from the audience. The article presents tips and practices used in the industry as well as insights from real-world experiences to help designers create forms that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. </p>

            <p>One of the websites I believe to best exhibit good form design is <a href="https://shop.app/">Shop</a>. They provide one-tap checkout and real-time tracking when you make a purchase. Shop is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and a website that exemplifies the best practices for form design.</p>
