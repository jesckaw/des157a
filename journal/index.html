            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design"</a> provides valuable insights and guidelines for UX designers looking to create effective and user-friendly forms. The author covers various topics in form design, such as form length and content, input types, instructions and validation, accessibility, and user testing. </p>

            <p>When making forms, itâ€™s important to keep them short by using clear and concise language, and labeling form fields. Input types should also be appropriately stated for each field. Forms should include clear instructions, real-time validation, and feedback to provide a good user experience. Accessibility and user testing are also important pieces to gain feedback from the audience. The article presents tips and practices used in the industry as well as insights from real-world experiences to help designers create forms that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. </p>

            <p>One of the websites I believe to best exhibit good form design is <a href="https://shop.app/">Shop</a>. They provide one-tap checkout and real-time tracking when you make a purchase. Shop is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and a website that exemplifies the best practices for form design.</p>
