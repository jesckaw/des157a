                <figcaption>Icecream in the Summer - KC Diaz, 2022.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>KC's image shows a summer snack she got at Disneyland. Some of the most interesting aspects of this image is that it appears to be a snapshot of her day at the park. The photo captures a moment in time, showing a busy scene in a warm summer day with family and friends together. The bright colors and happy expressions on everyone's faces suggest that they are having a great time, enjoying each other's company and the park's attractions. However, the image only offers a glimpse of the scene, leaving viewers to wonder what other experiences they had that day.</p>

            <p>Apart from the joyful atmosphere, the image also leaves some aspects to the viewer's imagination. For example, while the focus is on the snack, the background appears to be blurred, raising questions about what else is going on in the park. What other attractions and scenery might be surrounding them? Furthermore, the snack itself seems to be an interesting topic. What is it made of? How does it taste? The image invites the viewer to explore more about the snack and the park, making it a fascinating glimpse into the world of Disneyland.</p>

            <p>My image reveals a cozy and rainy day at the tea shop. The image shows a busy, yet calm atmosphere for a day to drink tea. What makes this image interesting is the combination of contrasting elements. The rain outside creates a cozy atmosphere in the tea shop, while the busy scene adds to the calmness of the moment. Something you wouldn't know about this image is that before this photo was taken, my friends and I went to a career fair, before settling down with delicious scones and fragrant tea. Knowing this backstory adds a layer of meaning to the image and makes it more interesting.</p>

            <p>My photo relates to my topic on the value of calmness and aesthetic. As a collector of images, I value the ability of images to capture and convey emotions and moods. This image captures a moment of calm and relaxation amidst a busy day, and it speaks to the importance of taking a break and finding peaceful moments even in the midst of a hectic schedule. This image will be a nice addition to my archive because it embodies the themes of my collection and showcases my appreciation for the beauty of simple moments</p>

            <p>Here some of the best practices for these tools. Modal windows is to keep them concise, relevant, and accessible while providing an easy way to close them. Overlay best practices should ensure that content is displayed in the foreground with a distinct contrast, is clearly visible, and is free from any distractions.Dialog window best practice should include a clear title, concise content, and a prominent call-to-action to help guide users towards the desired outcome. </p>

            <p>Overall the best practices for modals, overlays, and dialog windows are to keep them concise and to the point, use them sparingly, keep the content relevant and concise, ensure they don't interfere with the user's progress, and provide an easy way to close the modal.

            <p>The article <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">"Best Practices for Form Design"</a> provides valuable insights and guidelines for UX designers looking to create effective and user-friendly forms. The author covers various topics in form design, such as form length and content, input types, instructions and validation, accessibility, and user testing. </p>

            <p>When making forms, it’s important to keep them short by using clear and concise language, and labeling form fields. Input types should also be appropriately stated for each field. Forms should include clear instructions, real-time validation, and feedback to provide a good user experience. Accessibility and user testing are also important pieces to gain feedback from the audience. The article presents tips and practices used in the industry as well as insights from real-world experiences to help designers create forms that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. </p>

            <p>One of the websites I believe to best exhibit good form design is <a href="https://shop.app/">Shop</a>. They provide one-tap checkout and real-time tracking when you make a purchase. Shop is easy to use, aesthetically pleasing, and a website that exemplifies the best practices for form design.</p>
