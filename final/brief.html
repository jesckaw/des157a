            <h3>Project Summary</h3>
            <p>I will be revamping my "Game On!" project. In this updated version, my project is going to feature a retro style game of pig where users will encounter a fun surprise at the end. I plan to include additional sounds and more animations. With the updates, players can enjoyfun interactions and better visuals while playing the game.</p>

            <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <p>I am updating my "Game On!" project, which is a retro-style game of pig with added surprise elements. I plan to improve the user experience with additional sounds and animations. For Comparison Project 1, I evaluated <a href="https://www.retrogames.cc/">RetroGames.cc</a>, which has a simple interface design but lacks additional features. For Comparison Project 2, I evaluated <a href="https://www.miniclip.com/games">MiniClip</a>, which has a visually appealing interface and offers various features like leaderboards and multiplayer options. However, there are frequent advertisements that can interrupt gameplay.</p>

            <h3>Design Strategies</h3>
            <p>he overall look and feel of the website will be retro and cute. The color scheme will be inspired by nature, with a combination of earthy tones such as yellow, orange, red, and brown. The typography will be a geometric and pixelated sans-serif font that is easy to read called DM Mono. The design elements will be aligned with the principles of vintage gaming, using pixelated textures and vintage aesthetics. The Gestalt principles of proximity, similarity, and continuity will be applied to create a cohesive and intuitive user interface.</p>

            <h3>Interaction Strategies</h3>
            <p>The website will have a pleasing design, ensuring that it works seamlessly to many audiences.The navigation will be intuitive and user-friendly, with clear labels and easy-to-use buttons. Time-based behaviors such as loading animations and transitions will be used to enhance the user experience. Visual feedback will be provided to users whenever they perform an action such as rolling dice, passing turns, or restarting the game. Every inputs from the player will display animated visual bars to help users keep track of their scores in a more interactive way.</p>

            <h3>Experience Goals</h3>
            <p>The primary goal of the website is to provide a seamless and enjoyable gaming experience for players who want to enjoy a simple and fun game. The website game will provide a seamless display of information as the game progresses, providing a good user experience for players. The website will be designed to promote fun for our players.
