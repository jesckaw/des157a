            <h3>User Test One</h3>
            <p> Tester one mentioned that they had no dislikes and liked the colors of the game. However, they also noted that the background music was alright, and made a remark that royalty-free music usually sounds funny. Additionally, they suggested adding more sounds, specifically for winning and losing the game.</p>

            <h3>User Test Two</h3>
            <p>Tester two had positive feedback about the game's interactions, stating that they liked the hover states and clear overlays. However, they also suggested adding a "try again" reload option and noted that the start game button made them want to click it. They enjoyed the graphics and illustrations, as well as the winning sound effect.

            <h3>User Test Three</h3>
            <p>Tester three said the game has a comforting and warm vibe because of the game's colors and theme, and also appreciated how everything tied together. They liked the egg and chicken concepts, remarking that it goes well with the 8-bit style. They thought that the background music was reminescent of retro games. They found the interactions clean, with good timing and visibility. However, they suggested adding a sound for passing and appreciated the game-over sound. If they were a first-time player, they thought instructions would be helpful too.</p>

            <h3>My Plan</h3>
            <p>Based on the feedback I received from the user tests, I have decided to implement changes to improve the game. User Test Two suggested adding a "try again" button to make it easier to restart the game, while User Test Three suggested adding a sound for when you click pass, and a quick instruction alert in the beginning for new players. So, I'm going to make these changes to the game. Players will now be able to hit "try again" that redirect it to the start without choosing a new player. I will also add a sound for when a player passes a level, which will make the game more engaging. Additionally, I will include a little alert at the beginning with instructions to help new players get started. I believe these changes will make the game more enjoyable and user-friendly for everyone.</p>
